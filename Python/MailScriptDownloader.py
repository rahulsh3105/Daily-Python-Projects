#About Project
#Can't create, edit or upload â€¦ Not enough storage. Get more now, or remove files from Drive, Google Photos or Gmail.
#Attachment Downloader
#The script downloads gmail atttachment(s) in no time!

#Setup Instructions
#The script uses ezgmail module (to know more visit https://pypi.org/project/EZGmail/). To install please type the following command in your bash.

#```bash
#pip install EZGmail```
#Once the module is installed you will need to download credentials.json file by going to [developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python) and clicking the Enable the Gmail API button (select "Desktop app" as OAuth Client in second step).
#Once you have credentials.json (in root directory of project folder), the first time you run the script it will open up a browser window asking you to log in to your Gmail account and allow "Quickstart" app to access it. A token.json file will be generated (in root directory of project folder) which your script can use to access your account.
